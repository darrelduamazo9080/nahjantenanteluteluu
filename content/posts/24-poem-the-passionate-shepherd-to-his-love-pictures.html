        <p>First published in 1599, in the passionate pilgrim, followed by a slightly expanded version in england&#039;s helicon in 1600, this is a pastoral poem whose speaker is a shepherdâ€¦ marlowe&#039;s primary use of concrete nouns may suggest that the speaker feels a love so real that it is almost tangible.</p>
