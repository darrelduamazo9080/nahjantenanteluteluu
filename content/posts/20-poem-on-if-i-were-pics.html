If you can wait and not be tired by waiting or being lied about, don&#039;t deal in lies If i were a voice, a persuasive voice, that could travel the wide world through, i would fly on the beams of the morning light, and speak to men with a gentle if i were a voice, a consoling voice, i&#039;d fly on the wings of air, the homes of sorrow and guilt i&#039;d seek, and calm and truthful words i&#039;d speak to save.</p>

    <h3>If i were the principal.</h3>
    <p>Writers say poetry provides them with comfort, a way to express themselves and the discipline of finding the essence with few words. I think, if i were king of greece, i&#039;d push things off the mantelpiece. I shall not live in vain; In general, use if i were + noun + would.</p>
