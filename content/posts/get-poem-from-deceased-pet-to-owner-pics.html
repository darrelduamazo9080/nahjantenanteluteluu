                Monica wrote her first review and the owner of the restaurant comes to complain about it. I saw a poem from a deceased cat that told the owner to take in another cat the way she did him and take care of him and give another cat a home. A new edition, edited by richard j.

    <p>(in the reincarnation of basically good people, your angels and you agree on tasks to accomplish before each new life on earth begins.) this case below, which a wn writer, supporter of my work, and very appreciated donor sent, involves his deceased pet, buddy. There was a lot of roughhousing, play pinching and slapping, letting him use my hand for a chew toy. A great way is with a pet loss poem. Can you do it at home?</p>
